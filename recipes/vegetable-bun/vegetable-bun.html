        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps__list">
          <li>
            Start by making the dough. Let the dough set while preparing the
            filling ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Julienne 1 cup of cabbage and 1/4 cup of carrot. Finely chop ½ cup
            each of onion and green onions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare 1 cup of ground beef. You can also use ground pork, chicken,
            or turkey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the ground meat with 2 pinches salt, 2 pinches black pepper, and
            1 Tbsp oyster sauce for about 5 minutes on medium-high.
          </li>
          <li>After 5 minutes, add all the chopped vegetables to the meat.</li>
          <li>
            Season the filling ingredients with 1 generous tsp of Korean curry
            powder. Then, fry it for 5 more minutes on medium-high. The curry
            powder is the secret ingredient for this recipe.
          </li>
          <li>After 5 minutes, divide the filling into 8 portions.</li>
          <li>
            Divide the dough into 8 portions and form each piece into a ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternatively, if you want to go the easy route, try Pillsbury
            Buttermilk Biscuit dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the biscuits container to find 8 pieces of dough ready to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut 8 sheets of parchment paper into about 3 x 3 inch squares.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can either steam or bake these. Roll out each ball of dough into
            a 4 inch circle if you are going to steam them, or a 3 inch circle
            if you are going to bake them. The dough should be about ⅛ of an
            inch thick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put each divided portion of the filling into the center of each
            piece of dough.
          </li>
          <li>Wrap the filling with the dough and seal it.</li>
          <li>
            Gently roll the bun with your hands to make the surface smooth and
            round. If you are going to steam the buns, place them on the
            parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>Use the same process for the rest of the buns.</li>
          <li>
            Place the buns in the steamer and put the steamer on a pot with some
            boiling water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pot, but keep one side a little open. By doing this, the
            surface of the hobbang can be steamed beautifully without being
            wrinkled. Steam the buns for about 15 minutes on high.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let them cool down for a few
            minutes before you open the lid and take out the buns.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to bake the buns, preheat your oven to 325 degrees F.
            Make 8 buns with the biscuit dough and put the buns on a cookie
            sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake the buns for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the surface
            becomes nice golden brown.
          </li>
