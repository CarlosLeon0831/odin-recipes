        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul class="steps__list">
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">1.</p>
            On a sheet pan or a brownie pan, coat the bottom of the pan by
            spreading out the roasted soybean flour with your hands. For the 2
            cup rice flour recipe, I spread about 9x8 inch area of my 9x13
            brownie pan. So I guess an 8x8 pan will work too. Sprinkle about 1
            tsp of sugar and a light sprinkle of salt on top of the soybean
            flour. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">2.</p>
            In a microwavable bowl, add sweet rice flour (aka mochiko flour),
            salt and sugar. Mix with a whisk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">3.</p>
            Add water to flour mixture and mix with a spatula until everything
            is well blended and no dry flour exists. Be sure to scrape the
            bottom of the bowl to mix in all the flour. Even out the top with a
            spatula and cover with a plastic wrap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">4.</p>
            Put the covered bowl in the microwave and cook on HIGH for 2
            minutes. Take out the bowl, remove the wrap (be careful of the hot
            steam as you uncover). You will see that only the top inch layer or
            so is cooked. Using a spatula, mix it so the top layer goes to the
            bottom and the uncooked mixture comes to the top. Cover with a wrap
            once again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">5.</p>
            Microwave HIGH for 2 minutes again. Uncover, mix and cover with wrap
            one last time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">6.</p>
            Now, microwave HIGH for just 1 minute. Uncover and this time, dip
            the spatula in cold water and mix a couple of times. Repeat 2-3
            times. This helps the rice cake not stick to the spatula too much
            and also cools down the tteok a little bit while adding additional
            moisture. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer to kind of knead
            the dough. Do it for 1-2 minutes and sprinkle about 1/2 to 1 Tbs of
            water while you knead it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">7.</p>
            Have the soybean flour sheet pan and bowl of cold water ready. Put
            disposable plastic gloves on. The plastic gloves are not a must but
            it just makes things easier (not have your hand all covered in
            tteok). Form the Injeolmi rice cake into one ball using a spatula
            (because it will still be too hot for your hands) and transfer it
            over to the center of the sheet pan. Now, wet your plastic gloves
            with cold water and quickly press down the rice cake to spread it
            out. Repeat wetting your gloves if you feel it's too hot or it's
            sticking. Press and spread until it covers most of the soybean
            powder area or until you get your desired thickness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="step__number">8.</p>
            Cover the top with more soybean powder. Using scissors, cut it into
            long strips and then each strip into smaller squares or rectangles.
            For each cut piece, cover the cut sides with soybean flour so it's
            fully covered all around. The soybean powder prevents Injeolmi from
            drying out.
          </li>

            Enjoy with some lovely tea and honey for dipping!</li>
